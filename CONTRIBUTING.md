# Contributing to Cereja üçí 

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

So ü§î ... how many times have you needed to rewrite that function or base class? Well, I thought then of joining all my lines of code, bit by bit, in one place.

Not well structured yet :( ... But you can help me !!! üò¨

Do not be shy \0/ ... Clone the repository and submit a function or module you made or use some function you liked.

Rules:
- Use [PEP-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
- Implement a test for each role you created
- if you are going to create a new module let the Cereja create for you: In the root directory of the cherry type the command
    - `python -m cereja --startmodule path/to/new_module.py`
